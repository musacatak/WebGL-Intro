### Task
Your task in this assignment is to write a WebGL application (HTML and Javascript codes) that displays the first letter of your first name and the last letter (uppercase) of your last name. Simple, right? However, there is one condition! You should only print letters using geometric primitives (dots, lines, and triangles).

#### To Do
*	In your program, by using GUI elements and through keyboard and mouse, user should be able to,
    * change the color for the letters;
    * reposition (translate), rotate, or scale the letters together or separately.  
* You are free to design how and for what the user can use the keyboard and mouse but there has to be at least some interaction with both of them. Also your choices should be natural and easy to use. 
*	A report of at least 2 pages describing the program you have written in detail should be prepared (Font: Times New Roman, 12 Points). In the report, which of the functions described above (drawing letters, changing color, relocating, rotating and scaling, using the keyboard and mouse) works in the program should be specified in a table, the codes of the working parts should be shown and explained in the report.
